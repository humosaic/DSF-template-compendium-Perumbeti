# Learner Log Entry #5

## Prompts
*Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:*

### Rose:
**The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.**  
*This week in FOSS we learned about communication and github pages.  We went through a tutotial for copying a template for an academic page, setting it up as a github page, and configuring github actions to update the url when changes are made.  

### Bud: 
**Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.**  
*I am looking forward to editing the markdown in the github academic page that I copied through the tutorial, and better understanding the code structure and html of the template. It was also good to continue to practice markdown.

### Thorn: 
**Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.**  
*I tried editing the html, which broke the page.  I tried to revert to a prior version, and that didn't work.  I ended up starting over which was good practice.  Still have to become comfortable with version control features.  I also noticed my computer git repo and web repo wasn't synched up, so i tried git pull . inside the repo that wasn't synched, and it didn't pull the changes from my web repo into my local repo.

## Additional thought
**Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.**  
*Continue to write code, even if its bad code.*
