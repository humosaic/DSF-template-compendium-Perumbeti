# Learner Log Entry #5

## Prompts
*Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:*

### Rose:
**The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.**  
*This week in FOSS we reviewed Git and Github.*

### Bud: 
**Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.**  
*I synched some repositories from command line.  I wrote some R code for the GEO pipeline in a RMD file.  This is a test for VScode*

### Thorn: 
**Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.**  
*I would like to see if you can nest multiple related repositories in a single folder.  It appears this is possible locally, but Github requires each repo to be independent.  I still haven't figured out how to push changes from CL in local git without generating a token.  I have been able to create R project, save it in a git repo local folder, and push to Github, but not sure how to synch Github directly from R studio project.*

## Additional thought
**Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.**  
*Continue to write code, even if its bad code.*
