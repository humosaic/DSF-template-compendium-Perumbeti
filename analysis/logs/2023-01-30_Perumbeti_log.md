# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
*Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:*

### Rose:
*The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.*
This last week we focused on command line, git, markdown, log and readme files, and encouraging elements of open science.  I set up a new github repository using Dr. Chism's Data Science Template.  I also replicated the template for use with a few of my projects: P1_BCD-Fe, P2_HEIRS-Fe, P4_XY-Fe.

### Bud: 
*Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.* I would like to download a pipeline template for handling .soft files for P4_XY-Fe, and write some code with git and github for handling flat files.

### Thorn: 
*Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.* I need to better understand how others document in their github for reproducible science, by studying Dr. Chism's github template files. 

## Additional thought
*Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.*
2023-01-24: This sentence is to test humosaic github repository clone, add, commit, and push
I am also thinking about FOSS mention of generating code library references in R and Python from pipeline code.
