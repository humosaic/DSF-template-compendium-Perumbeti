## Prompts
*Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:*

### Rose:
**The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.**  
This week in FOSS we learned about project management, particularly developing a document detailing project specifications including documentation, file storage, and communication.  We learned about a research object which is a URL that points to a file structure which contains everything your would need to reproduce a unit of work. 

### Bud: 
**Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.**  
I am looking forward to syncing my Github desktop from two computers (ubuntu and windows) to my cloud github.  The two choices are continuously sync clones, or branch and pull from my cloud github to my local computer when I would like to work on something locally, and then push changes to github. 


### Thorn: 
**Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.**  
I would like to get some project code into github.  To start:  a simple python random forest analysis of a CSV file, a R pipeline remplate to analyze .soft microarray data files from GEO, an analysis of HEIRS with plots and sML.

## Additional thought
**Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.**  
Write some code, even if its bad code.
