# Learner Log Entry #2 

## Prompts
*Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:*

### Rose:
*The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.*
This week in FOSS we learned about project management, particularly developing a document detailing project specifications including documentation, file storage, and communication.  We learned about a research object which is a URL that points to a file structure which contains everything your would need to reproduce a unit of work. 

### Bud: 
*Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.*  I am looking forward to syncing my Github desktop from two computers to my cloud github, and learning how to work when on my Windows and linux computer effectictively.  The two choices are continuously sync clones, or branch and pull from my cloud github to my local computer when I would like to work on something, and then push and merge back into the main branch when I work on something. 


### Thorn: 
*Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.*  I would like to get some project code into github and work with code for a simple python random forest analysis of a flat file, and the start of a R pipeline to analyze .soft microarray data files from GEO.  Next I have a HEIRS data set I would like to start working with using Python data analysis with version control.

## Additional thought
*Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.*
I must write code daily, even if its bad code in the beginning.
