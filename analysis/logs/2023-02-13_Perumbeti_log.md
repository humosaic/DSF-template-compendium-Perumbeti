### Rose:
**The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.**  
*This week in   FOSS we learned about project and data management.  We discussed tools for data management including (ds-wizard.org & DMPTool.org: data management plan), (openproject.org, and Zenhub/Github Issues: project management software).  We also learned FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable; Along with CARE: Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics.

### Bud: 
**Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.**  
*I am looking forward to I am looking forward to picking one of the data management tools and project management tools, and trying to see how my projects could be built in the resources.

### Thorn: 
**Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.**  
*Openproject may have a significant learning curve.  I wonder if other's use it.

## Additional thought
**Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.**  
*Continue to write code, even if its bad code.*
