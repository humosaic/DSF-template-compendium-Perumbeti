# Learner Log Entry #7

## Prompts
*Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:*

### Rose:
**The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.**  
*This week in FOSS was container camp!  We learned some container basics.  The focus was on Docker and Singularity engines and commands*    
### Bud: 
**Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.**  
*I am looking forward to building containers for my P1_BDC, P2_HEIRS, and P4_XY-Fe projects.  This will be the focus for my capstone.  My second focus is building some additional content and working with the webpage file.

### Thorn: 
**Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.**  
*I will need to revisit the last two weeks on automation and containers to retain and grow the learning.  I would also like to get my R studio synch automation with Github.*

## Additional thought
**Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.**  
*Continue to write code, even if its bad code.*
